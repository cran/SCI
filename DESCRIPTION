Description: Functions for generating Standardized Climate Indices (SCI).
  Functions for generating Standardized Climate Indices (SCI). 
  SCI is a transformation of (smoothed) climate (or environmental) time series 
  that removes seasonality and forces the data to take values of the standard 
  normal distribution. SCI was originally developed for precipitation. 
  In this case it is known as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
